                Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
                This is equivalent to concatenation along the third axis after 2-D arrays of shape(M, N) have been reshaped to(M, N,1) and 1-D arrays of shape(N,) have been reshaped to(1, N,1).
                Rebuilds arrays divided by dsplit. 
                This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions.For instance, for pixel-data with a height(first axis), width(second axis), and r/g/b channels(third axis). The functions concatenate, stack and block provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

             Returns a boolean array where two arrays are element-wise equal within a
             tolerance.
             The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.The    
             relative difference (`rtol` * abs(`b`)) and the absolute difference
             `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference
             between `a` and `b`.
             Warning: The default `atol` is not appropriate for comparing numbers
             that are much smaller than one(see Notes).
             
             See also <seealso cref="M:NumSharp.np.allclose(NumSharp.NDArray,NumSharp.NDArray,System.Double,System.Double,System.Boolean)"/>
            
            Notes:
             For finite values, isclose uses the following equation to test whether
             two floating point values are equivalent.
             <code>absolute(`a` - `b`) less than or equal to (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))</code>
             Unlike the built-in `math.isclose`, the above equation is not symmetric
             in `a` and `b` -- it assumes `b` is the reference value -- so that
             `isclose(a, b)` might be different from `isclose(b, a)`. Furthermore,
             the default value of atol is not zero, and is used to determine what
             small values should be considered close to zero.The default value is
             appropriate for expected values of order unity: if the expected values
             are significantly smaller than one, it can result in false positives.
             `atol` should be carefully selected for the use case at hand. A zero value
             for `atol` will result in `False` if either `a` or `b` is zero.

             The convolution operator is often seen in signal processing, where it models the effect of a linear time-invariant system on a signal[1]. In probability theory, the sum of two independent random variables is distributed according to the convolution of their individual distributions.

                Rebuilds arrays divided by dsplit. 
                This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions.For instance, for pixel-data with a height(first axis), width(second axis), and r/g/b channels(third axis). The functions concatenate, stack and block provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

             Returns the discrete, linear convolution of two one-dimensional sequences.
            
             The convolution operator is often seen in signal processing, where it models the effect of a linear time-invariant system on a signal[1]. In probability theory, the sum of two independent random variables is distributed according to the convolution of their individual distributions.
             
             If v is longer than a, the arrays are swapped before computation.

             See also <seealso cref="!:allclose"/>
            
            Notes:
             For finite values, isclose uses the following equation to test whether
             two floating point values are equivalent.
             <code>absolute(`a` - `b`) less than or equal to (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))</code>
             Unlike the built-in `math.isclose`, the above equation is not symmetric
             in `a` and `b` -- it assumes `b` is the reference value -- so that
             `isclose(a, b)` might be different from `isclose(b, a)`. Furthermore,
             the default value of atol is not zero, and is used to determine what
             small values should be considered close to zero.The default value is
             appropriate for expected values of order unity: if the expected values
             are significantly smaller than one, it can result in false positives.
             `atol` should be carefully selected for the use case at hand. A zero value
             for `atol` will result in `False` if either `a` or `b` is zero.

            Implementation Notes:

             Used for symmetric except when other isn't a HashSet. This is more tedious because 
             other may contain duplicates. HashSet technique could fail in these situations:
             1. Other has a duplicate that's not in this: HashSet technique would add then 
             remove it.
             2. Other has a duplicate that's in this: HashSet technique would remove then add it
             back.
             In general, its presence would be toggled each time it appears in other. 
             
             This technique uses bit marking to indicate whether to add/remove the item. If already
             present in collection, it will get marked for deletion. If added from other, it will

            have elements not in this and everything in this is in other
            3. Proper subset: checks if unfoundCount > 0 and uniqueFoundCount = m_count; i.e
            other must have at least one element not in this and everything in this is in other
            4. Proper superset: checks if unfound count = 0 and uniqueFoundCount strictly less
            than m_count; i.e. everything in other was in this and this had at least one element
            not contained in other.
            
            An earlier implementation used delegates to perform these checks rather than returning
            an ElementCount struct; however this was changed due to the perf overhead of delegates.

            a[start:]      # items start through the rest of the array                                                                                        <br></br>
            a[:stop]       # items from the beginning through stop-1                                                                                          <br></br>
                                                                                                                                                              <br></br>
            The key point to remember is that the :stop value represents the first value that is not                                                          <br></br>
            in the selected slice. So, the difference between stop and start is the number of elements                                                        <br></br>
            selected (if step is 1, the default).                                                                                                             <br></br>
                                                                                                                                                              <br></br>
            There is also the step value, which can be used with any of the above:                                                                            <br></br>
            a[:]           # a copy of the whole array                                                                                                        <br></br>
            a[start:stop:step] # start through not past stop, by step                                                                                         <br></br>
                                                                                                                                                              <br></br>
            The other feature is that start or stop may be a negative number, which means it counts                                                           <br></br>
            from the end of the array instead of the beginning. So:                                                                                           <br></br>
            a[-1]    # last item in the array                                                                                                                 <br></br>
            a[-2:]   # last two items in the array                                                                                                            <br></br>
            a[:-2]   # everything except the last two items                                                                                                   <br></br>
            Similarly, step may be a negative number:                                                                                                         <br></br>

            a[::- 1]    # all items in the array, reversed                                                                                                    <br></br>

                                                                                                                                                              <br></br>
            NumSharp is kind to the programmer if there are fewer items than                                                                                  <br></br>
            you ask for. For example, if you  ask for a[:-2] and a only contains one element, you get an                                                      <br></br>
            empty list instead of an error.Sometimes you would prefer the error, so you have to be aware                                                      <br></br>
            that this may happen.                                                                                                                             <br></br>
                                                                                                                                                              <br></br>

            I originally used the Taylor series for ASin, but it was extremely slow
            around -1 and 1 (millions of iterations) and still ends up being less
            accurate than deriving from the ATan function.
