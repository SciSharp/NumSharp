## Description

While porting a Python code to .NET using NumSharp as replacement for numpy - I found that there is no alternative version for `np.random.triangular` api present in NumSharp. I tried to search in the documents and didn't find any reference to it. Here is the link to the documentation for the API in numpy https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.triangular.html

NumSharp version I am using: `0.30.0`.
