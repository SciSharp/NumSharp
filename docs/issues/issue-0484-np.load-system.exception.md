## Description

I am loading several arrays in Unity using NumSharp's `np.load`. It works well for most of them but one throws an exception :

In NumPy `np.load` works fine for this this array.

[here is a link to download this specific array](https://github.com/SciSharp/NumSharp/files/10268745/array.zip).

What is the reason behind this exception ?

Thank you
