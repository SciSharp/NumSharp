## Description

Are there any plans to implement these? Or are they already in place and I am just not getting the syntax right? Thank you!

I am also finding this...I found that nd[true] works,however not for a variable value,for example nd[nd>0].
Could you please tell me if you have found a solution?thank you very much!
