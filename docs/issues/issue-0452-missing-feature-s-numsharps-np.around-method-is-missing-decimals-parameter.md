## Description

In NumPy user has control over on how many decimal places the floating point number can be rounded to by setting **decimal** argument in **[numpy.around()](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.around.html)** method.

However, NumSharp is missing this functionality.

It would be better if this feature is added to NumSharp's np.around() method.
