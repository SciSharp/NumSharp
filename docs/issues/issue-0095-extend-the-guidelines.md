## Description

@Oceania2018 @fdncred I started our Wiki (was not a lot but at least some lines ....) 

On https://github.com/Oceania2018/NumSharp/wiki/Design-guidelines I started a page with guidelines. 
Because I found our discussions and investigations last weeks very interesting and want to write them down. Especially casting, performance, arange instead of ARange, ... such things. 

If you do not like some parts, or want to add something, feel free to change. ;)

@dotChris90 @fdncred I've wrote an article [here](https://medium.com/@haiping008/numsharp-works-with-matplotlib-213f1753480).

Awesome! Good job. Maybe you should put your c# demo app in the repo as an example.

Amazing. I really was impressed when saw it. 🤩

By the way. Technically background question.

You used a matplotlib adapter and in background also using matplotlib. Amazing.

I was wondering how much work it would be to make a own matplotlib but html based.

In my mind hat sth like
- tiny web sever in background
- plotly.js as drawing lib
- chromely project for rendering

Our hard work is worth it. NumSharp is providing enough methods to support high level library.
@dotChris90 I don't want to implement a ploting library for now. Let's focus on NumSharp and Pandas.NET.

Sure and agree.

OH seems the f# guys already have sth like this with their xplot project so maybe even later no reason for us to implement
