## Description

Here is a link to what I think is the python sources for np.linalg:
https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/linalg/linalg.py

Other implementations:
https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Sharp/blob/master/Algorithms/Numeric/Pseudoinverse/PseudoInverse.cs
https://github.com/accord-net/framework/blob/master/Sources/Accord.Math/Matrix/Matrix.Linear.Generated.cs#L298
