## Description

In the following thread there is some nice advice on how to set up Numsharp in unity:
https://github.com/SciSharp/NumSharp/issues/353
However, I've been asking myself if people have tested its performance. I reccon that it should work well with the Unitys Mono backend, but will it also have relatively good performance if choosing the IL2CPP backend?
