## Description

Hi, I am having trouble with building an Android app that is using a NumSharp package in Unity. 

This is the error that I keep receiving:
IL2CPP error for type 'NumSharp.LAPACKProviderType' in assembly '/UnityProject/Temp/StagingArea/assets/bin/Data/Managed/NumSharp.Core.dll'
Additional information: Value of type 'int' is too large to convert to short.

Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks
